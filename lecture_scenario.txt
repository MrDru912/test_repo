lecture scenario on 3 nodes

prelim requests:
r1:
p2->r1
p1->r1 (p1->p2)

r2:
p2->r2
p3->r2(p3->p2)

r3:
p1->r3
p3->r3(p3->p1)

p2 requests r2 = r2 granted to p2 cuz no cycles detected on r2 graph

p1 requests r1 = cycle detected on r1, r1 not granted, request delayed

p3 reqeusts r3 = cycle detected on r3, r3 not granted, request delayed

p2 requests r1 = no cycles, r1 granted to p2

p2 release r1 = r1 check delayed requests and finds rqeuest from p1, checks cycles. no cycles detected, r1 granted to p1

p2 release r2 = no delayed requests to proceed with

p1 request r3 = no cyles detected, r3 granted to p1

p1 release r1

p1 release r3 = r3 finds delayed request from p3, check cycles, grants r3 to p3

p3 requests r2, no cycles detetcted, r2 granted to p3

p3 release r2

p3 release r3
